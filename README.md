# ML Signal Processing

Welcome to the `ml_signal_processing` project! This repository contains various signal processing algorithms implemented using machine learning techniques, 
starting with the Kalman filter. The goal of this project is to explore and implement various signal processing methods and their applications in machine learning.

## Examples

### Kalman Voltage Estimation

The `Kalman_Voltage_Estimation.py` script demonstrates the use of the Kalman filter to estimate noisy voltage measurements. 
It includes functions to simulate voltage measurements, apply the Kalman filter, and plot the results.

### Kalman Sonar Estimation

The `Kalman_Sonar_Estimation.py` script demonstrates the use of the Kalman filter to estimate the position and velocity of an object based on noisy sonar measurements. 
It includes functions to simulate sonar measurements, apply the Kalman filter, and plot the results.
